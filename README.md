# SQL-Project-HBOMax-Analysis

Project Name:
HBOMax Analysis

Project Objective:
My goal was to find and identify movies available on HBOMax that were underperforming or low rated to recommend them to be removed or decreased in streaming resource
to improve efficiency. I also wanted to identify popular movies to recommend increasing resources for streaming them.
  I was solving this problem through comparing ratings and popularities for movies available on HBOMax, through webscraping the list of available movies on ReelGood
  
Job Description:
The job was for HBO's HBOMax streaming service, as a content analyst. HBOMax is the streaming service under the parent company of HBO, who provides movie and film content.
The role of content analyst involved creating reports and providing insight for the management team to make in depth and decisions to push HBOMax to grow and improve customer engagement.

This project directly relates with the job posting as it involves providing suggestions for upper management to best optimize the delivery of content towards customers, and improve customer engagement.

Data:
The data was webscraped from Reelgood by looking at the main list of films available on HBO, and pulling the hrefs for each listing.
The data involved name, year and IMDB rating.

Future Improvements:
I wish I had more time to pull more information from the webscrape involving genres and maturity rating, to give more metrics to compare to and give a more accurate report.
I also discovered late in the project the ability to filter by decade, and would have enjoyed finding the top/bottom 3 films in each decade.
